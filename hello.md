# Hello, world!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/crop-and-blur.jpg" alt="profound selfie" style="width:400px">
I made this picture several years ago (notice how brown my beard
was back then) by sitting between two computers facing each other,
to try to get an effect like you do with two mirrors.  Later it
occurred to me that the picture could be understood to represent
the way we often portray ourselves online.  The real me is blurry
and just partly visible; the fake me is in focus but heavily
filtered.  There's also the recursive effect you get with
two mirrors, a series of pictures fading out as they get smaller
and smaller.  This could be symbolic of the way so much online
"content" is just a reference to something else, which in turn
references something else, which references yet another
source, etc.
