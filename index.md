# Why study computer science?

I teach Computer Science at Messiah University.  So sometimes I ask
myself, why should students want to learn about computer science?
Because they might be good at it?  Because there are lots of
interesting problems to solve?  Because there are good jobs?  Yes,
of course.  But also, I think we should study computer science
in order to understand the technological culture in which we live.
We are surrounded by technological products and devices of many
kinds.  The interface these devices present to us is clear but often
shallow and artificial.  Our interaction
with them is limited; we are consumers of the final
product, without any part in (or understanding of) the process
required to create that product.

Studying computer science is a way to begin
to understand the incredible complexity of software and hardware
working together in the background to produce what we see on the
screen.  Better yet, as we learn more about how it all works, we
can interact with computers in increasingly creative ways,
perhaps even creating new technologies that invite others to
participate in this fascinating world, to become *learners* rather
than just *users*.  <!-- blog link? -->


# What should I be working on (instead of this website)?

Most semesters I teach Computer Programming I
([CIS 181](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=181) at Messiah University) and Computer Programming II
([CIS 284](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=284)).
For Programming I, we use the first 9 chapters of John Zelle's book
[*Python Programming:  An Introduction to Computer Science*](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/).
For Programming II, we use the first 3 chapters of Robert Sedgewick
and Kevin Wayne's book, [*Introduction to Programming in Java:
An Interdisciplinary Approach*](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/),
supplemented with content from Oracle's
[Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
and Joshua Bloch's book,
[*Effective Java*](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Bloch-Effective-Java-2nd-Edition/PGM310651.html).
(Some day I would like to write a sort of
"Effective Java for Beginners," which would take some of Bloch's
ideas and put them in a form that's more accessible to students
in their first Java course.)

In addition to the introductory programming courses, I teach a
course in computer organization and systems programming
([CIS 384](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=384)),
as well as courses in operating systems
([CIS 416](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=416)),
computer graphics,
([CIS 487](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=487)),
game design,
([CIS 287](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=287))
and programming languages
([CIS 482](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=482)).


## The Background

The background for this page is dynamically generated from the
HTML source code from which the page is produced.  The idea was
to suggest something going on behind what you see on the
screen—something fuzzy and inaccessible but perhaps more real
than the clearly displayed surface presentation.  (Here is
[an odd picture](profound_selfie.md) that sort of expresses the
same idea.)  Also this seemed
like an interesting challenge—how would you write the JavaScript,
CSS, etc. required to make a page display its own syntax-highlighted
HTML source code ...?  Here are the relevant files if you are
interested: [src.css](css/src.css), [src.js](js/src.js).

I used [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
to do the syntax highlighting, with my all-time favorite color
scheme, [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) light.
