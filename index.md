# Hello, world!

<!-- ![profound selfie](/images/crop-and-blur.jpg) -->
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/crop-and-blur.jpg" alt="profound selfie" style="width:200px">
This picture, made a couple of years ago for a
Twitter account, is supposed to represent the
way people sometimes portray themselves online.
The real me is blurry and just partly visible;
the fake me is in focus but heavily filtered.  You
might see also that I tried to hold the camera in
a way that would produce the recursive effect you can get with
two mirrors facing each other.  This is meant to
be symbolic of the way so much online "content"
is just a reference to something else, which in turn
references something else, which references yet another
"source," etc.

The background for this page is dynamically generated from the
HTML source code from which the page is produced.  Like the
picture, it's supposed to suggest something going on
behind what you see on the screen---something fuzzy and inaccessible
but perhaps more real than the clearly displayed surface
presentation.  (Also it seemed like an interesting challenge---how
would you write the JavaScript, CSS, etc. required to make a page
display its own syntax-highlighted HTML source code...?)

# Why study computer science?

I teach Computer Science at Messiah <span style="text-decoration:line-through">College</span> University.  So sometimes I ask
myself, why should students want to learn about computer science?
Because they might be good at it?  Because there are lots of
interesting problems to solve?  Because there are good jobs?  Yes,
of course.  But also, I think we should study computer science
in order to understand the technological culture in which we live.
We are surrounded by technological products and devices of many
kinds.  Like the "fake me" in the picture above, the interface
these devices
present to us is clear but shallow and artificial.  Our interaction
with them is limited; we are consumers of the final
product, without any part in (or understanding of) the process
required to create that product.

Studying computer science is a way to begin
to understand the incredible complexity of software and hardware
working together in the background to produce what we see on the
screen.  Better yet, as we learn more about how it all works, we
can interact with computers in increasingly creative ways,
perhaps even creating new technologies that invite others to
participate in this fascinating world, to become "understanders,"
not just "users."

# What should I be working on (instead of this website)?

Most semesters I teach Computer Programming I
([CIS 181](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=181)
at Messiah <span style="text-decoration:line-through">College</span> University) and Computer Programming II
([CIS 284](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=284)).
For Programming I, we use the first 9 chapters of John Zelle's book
[*Python Programming:  An Introduction to Computer Science*](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/).
For Programming II, we use the first 3 chapters of Robert Sedgewick
and Kevin Wayne's book, [*Introduction to Programming in Java:
An Interdisciplinary Approach*](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/),
supplemented with content from Oracle's
[Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
and Joshua Bloch's book,
[*Effective Java*](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Bloch-Effective-Java-2nd-Edition/PGM310651.html).
(Some day I intend to write up a sort of
"Effective Java for Beginners," which would take some of Bloch's
ideas and put them in a form that's more accessible to students
in their first Java course.)

In addition to the introductory programming courses, I teach a
course in computer organization and systems programming
([CIS 384](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=384)),
as well as courses in operating systems
([CIS 416](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=416))
and computer graphics
([CIS 487](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=487)).
I've also helped to teach the computer programming portion of
our game design course
([CIS 287](https://banner.messiah.edu:5000/BANR/mc_bwckctlg.P_EnterCatalog?subject=CIS&course=287)).

# What else?

Here are some other things I wish I had more time to work on.
(If this website is out of date, I've probably been working on
one of these projects and forgotten about it.)

-   I imagine this might someday be a book about 3D graphics
    programming for the web: <https://dvon.github.io/cgbk/>.

    Here's a related tutorial presentation for the [CCSC
    Eastern](http://www.ccsc-eastern.org) fall 2016 conference,
    showing how to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
    for a site that needs to have good-looking source code
    examples and mathematical notation:
    <https://dvon.github.io/ccsc-tutorial/>.

-   Various Python programs I use to work with the
    [Canvas](https://www.canvaslms.com/)
    [API](https://api.instructure.com/)
    from the command-line, together with related programs for
    working with
    [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):
    <https://github.com/dvon/canvas-cli/>.

-   Example programs from Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski's
    [*Learning OpenCV 3*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044765.do),
    translated
    ([from C++](https://github.com/oreillymedia/Learning-OpenCV-3_examples))
    to Python 3: <https://github.com/dvon/locv/>.

-   A project using OpenCV to analyze images of census forms, with
    the idea of eventually speeding up the process of data collection:
    <https://github.com/dvon/burg/>.

-   A song based on Jesus' words in Matthew 5:44-45, with
    a tune I made up around the time my oldest son Gareth was a baby:
    [Like Your Father (Gareth's Waltz)]({{ site.baseurl }}/music/like_your_father.pdf).
    And another song, based on John 1:18: [The Only Son]({{ site.baseurl }}/music/the_only_son.pdf).

## Acknowledgments

The idea for the picture and the source code in the background
comes from reading Albert Borgmann's
[*Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology*](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/power-failure/227810),
which introduced me to the "device paradigm," his way of talking
about the division between the "commodity" presented to consumers
and the hidden "machinery" required to make it happen.  
I used [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
to do the syntax highlighting, with the light version of the
[solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
colorscheme.
