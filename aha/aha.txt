# Disclaimer

-   I'm not a historian...
    -   And *computer vision* is not my research area.
    -   This is a subject I'm interested in, motivated to learn so
        that I might be able to teach a course in the future.

-   *I'd be glad to learn from you*, if anyone in the audience has
    experience in this area.

# Background

-   Census data available (from, e.g., Ancestry.com).
    -   But some information missing...transcribed by volunteers.
    -   Would be *beneficial to have an alternative* way of
        converting to images to text.

-   *Optical character recognition* (OCR) software is designed to
    recognize characters in image data.
    -   ...to *"read" the text in a picture*.
    -   It's particularly hard to recognize *handwritten*
        characters.

-   But maybe we don't need to recognize characters.
    -   If we had *a way to group similar images*...
    -   A human user could interpret a single image; that
        interpretation could be applied to all images in the group.

# Scans

-   What do *the scans we have* look like?
    -   [Example scan](example.jpg "example scan")...

-   How might we *generate a template* to represent what scans
    have in common?
    -   To specify where to crop cell images, where within cell
        image are boundaries to be deleted.
    -   [Composite image](composite.jpg "composite image")...

-   Will *a single template* will be sufficient?
    -   Is there enough consistency between scans?
    -   [Bad scan](bad.jpg "bad scan")...

# Cells

-   *Create an image for each cell.*
    -   Choose a form, choose a column.
    -   For each cell in column, copy and crop individual cell
        image.
    -   [Ownership columns](ownership_columns.jpg "ownership columns")...

-   Prepare cell image for comparison.
    -   *Delete* (horizontal and vertical) *cell boundaries*,
        based on template image.
    -   [One attempt at deleting boundaries](example_diff.jpg "attempt at deleting boundaries"),
        [another attempt](example_diff_ssim.jpg "another attempt at deleting boundaries")...
    -   Reconnect broken lines.  (*Working on an algorithm* for this;
        not sure how successful or necessary it will be.)

# Similarity Groups

-   Considering *all cell images from a column*...
    -   Across multiple form images, eventually?
    -   [Ownership columns](ownership_columns.jpg "ownership columns")
        (again)...

-   *Divide into similarity-based groups*.
    -   Using *scikit-image comparison functions*?
    -   K-Means approach, used in recognition of, e.g., Chinese
        characters, has also been suggested.

# User Interaction

-   Create annotated version of form image.
    -   *Mark images* to show which group they belong to.
    -   Provide indication of confidence level for similarity-based
        groups...*How similar are cells within group?*  How
        distinct are cells in different groups?  Which cell is a
        good representative?

-   Human user interaction...
    -   Verify similarity, based on sample of less-similar images
        from within a group.
    -   *Assign textual value*, based on representative image,
        for all images in group.
